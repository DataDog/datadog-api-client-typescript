# @datadog/datadog-api-client-metrics

## Description

The metrics endpoint allows you to:

- Post metrics data so it can be graphed on Datadogâ€™s dashboards
- Query metrics from any time period (timeseries and scalar)
- Modify tag configurations for metrics
- View tags and volumes for metrics

**Note**: A graph can only contain a set number of points
and as the timeframe over which a metric is viewed increases,
aggregation between points occurs to stay below that set number.

The Post, Patch, and Delete `manage_tags` API methods can only be performed by
a user who has the `Manage Tags for Metrics` permission.

See the [Metrics page](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/) for more information.
