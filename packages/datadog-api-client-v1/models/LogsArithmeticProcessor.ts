/**
 * Use the Arithmetic Processor to add a new attribute (without spaces or special characters
 * in the new attribute name) to a log with the result of the provided formula.
 * This enables you to remap different time attributes with different units into a single attribute,
 * or to compute operations on attributes within the same log.
 *
 * The formula can use parentheses and the basic arithmetic operators `-`, `+`, `*`, `/`.
 *
 * By default, the calculation is skipped if an attribute is missing.
 * Select “Replace missing attribute by 0” to automatically populate
 * missing attribute values with 0 to ensure that the calculation is done.
 * An attribute is missing if it is not found in the log attributes,
 * or if it cannot be converted to a number.
 *
 * *Notes*:
 *
 * - The operator `-` needs to be space split in the formula as it can also be contained in attribute names.
 * - If the target attribute already exists, it is overwritten by the result of the formula.
 * - Results are rounded up to the 9th decimal. For example, if the result of the formula is `0.1234567891`,
 *   the actual value stored for the attribute is `0.123456789`.
 * - If you need to scale a unit of measure,
 *   see [Scale Filter](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_configuration/parsing/?tab=filter#matcher-and-filter).
